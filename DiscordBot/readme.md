# Discord Bot

## Check out the Page on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dnshra/discordbot)

You should use the docker images provided because they make clean environments for testing out the bot.

Just run the image and when you are done you can stop and remove the container, without affecting the host system.

## Hikari API Reference

I like to use Hikari because it's super easy to implement slash commands, so I donâ€™t need to remember what commands I already implemented. 

Between starting and finishing this project discord.py got discontinued and then continued working on so in my opinion it's not stable enough to provide a long-term API Wrapper for Discord.
